With Reclaim's Slack integration, you automatically add Zoom meetings to your meeting invitations from Reclaim, and you can sync your Slack status and Do Not Disturb with events from your calendar without breaking a sweat. By connecting Reclaim to your Zoom account, Reclaim can now sync your Slack status with your Zoom meetings!When you enter a Zoom meeting — even if it's not on your calendar — Reclaim will set your status to \"in a meeting\" (or whatever you choose) automatically.When you leave a Zoom meeting — even if it ends ahead of time — Reclaim will automatically clear your status and reset it based on your schedule if needed.It's that simple. Just login with Zoom, and you'll be automatically redirected to the Reclaim app. Once you've done that, your status will start syncing with your Zoom meetings!Note: in order to use the Reclaim Zoom integration, you must have an active Reclaim account with the Slack integration connected. Reclaim is free forever, and you can sign up here using your Google Account login. If you already have a Reclaim account, you'll need to make sure you're logged in before you authenticate the integration.",

The metrics can later be dissected to provide better insights into product stability, customer experience or resource allocation.Auxiliary Codes & Wrap ModeAuxiliary Codes (or AUX codes) are used to track the time a Zoom Phone user has deliberately chosen to not accept calls. Shadow Agent allows for customizable AUX codes such as On Break, Bathroom Break or On Lunch. Timed states can automatically be set for a user after a call. These states are known as Wrap or After Call Work modes.Enhanced Agent / User Presence, Leaderboards Shadow Agent includes a powerful dynamic local presence dashboard that can be configured to show specific queues, departments, or users. Real time leaderboards can highlight user or agent activity and performance. Enterprise Analytics and Call Queue ReportingShadow Agent tightly integrates with Shadow All In One Analytics in the Zoom App Marketplace (link: https://link.telecost.com/shadowa1z) for account level enterprise reporting and real time dashboarding.  Requirements:Zoom Phone Admin Role for ConfigurationFor Browser Users:Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox (latest version)Windows Client Users:Windows 10+",

Call AI helps identify the skills required to be successful, measure individual and aggregate sales performance against those skills, and apply individualised coaching, training, and other remediation to help each Rep achieve top performance.By integrating Call AI with Zoom, any Zoom meeting scheduled on your calendar (Google or Outlook) can be recorded. As soon as the cloud recording starts in the Zoom meeting, Call AI bot automatically joins the meeting, records the conversation and generates useful insights.",

If your class time matches with an existing meeting in your Zoom account, then the app will pull this into MoveGB instead of creating a new one. You can still choose to manually input a Zoom meeting link even if you are integrated.Once your customer has checked-in to the activity, they'll receive the link on their pass to join your live-stream.

Remember the collaboration, the comradery, the cheap lukewarm coffee? Ok, so maybe working from home has not been that bad after all, but there were times when being physically close to your team was incredibly valuable. For instance, holding morning huddles to set the pace for the day, onboarding new employees, or quickly getting assistance for difficult service questions. These activities were easier when your peers were within arm’s reach.Fortunately for all of us, we can now have the best of both worlds. Oracle has now integrated everyone’s favorite collaboration tool, Zoom, directly into its agent browser UI for B2C service. Now you can instantly collaborate with your team members with the push of a button. Schedule time with your manager, hold a morning huddle, and even host the virtual happy hour without having to leave the agent desktop.Benefits: •\tZoom console is integrated into the Oracle B2C Agent Browser UI, eliminating the need for agents to switch interfaces•\tInstantly collaborate with peers•\tSchedule, host and track meetings from within the Oracle B2C Agent Browser UI",

        "description": "Phreesia gives healthcare organizations a suite of robust applications to manage the patient intake process. Our innovative SaaS platform engages patients in their healthcare and provides a modern, consistent experience, while enabling healthcare organizations to optimize their staffing and enhance clinical care.As an increasing number of providers adopt telehealth as a part of their mission to provide safe care to patients, they need more than a reliable and secure video-conferencing platform. Telehealth still means appointment scheduling, patient outreach and expectation setting, consent forms, clinical screeners including for COVID, session initiation, payment collection and post-visit communication.Phreesia is the industry leader in patient intake for telehealth - we handle all the other critical workflows so vendors like Zoom can focus on the video-conference. We've built an integration with Zoom that allows us to seamlessly add a Zoom meeting link to our emails and texts to patients - this saves staff having to manually call or email patients to arrange televisits. We also eliminate the need for double work scheduling appointments in both the Practice Management System & Zoom.How it works: 1. Before the visit, the patient is scheduled for a telehealth appointment 2. The patient receives an email or text to pre-register & sign consents 3. The patient reviews what to expect for the telehealth visit 4. On the day of and minutes before the visit, the patient gets an email or text to finalize their check in 5. A unique, password protected Zoom session is created & the meeting information is added to the provider's schedule 6. Phreesia prompts the patient to click a link to enter a virtual waiting room or is shown how to start the session",

Then you can  e﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿asily designate certain classes as 'online classes'.  Punchpass will automatically create the Zoom meeting in your account.  We then include the join URL in any reservation reminder emails, on the class details page, and we also email it to any reserved customers just before the class starts.  Online classes are automatically recorded and saved in your account, so you can send a link to any registered participants who didn't attend.Requirements:A Zoom plan of 'Pro' or higher is required.  The Zoom integration works on ANY Punchpass plan, though keep in mind that only the Balsam/Bedrock plans on Punchpass offer reservations (which is really where the integration shines.).

When a prospect visits a website and tries to talk to sales, there is a lot of back and forth involved to find a good time to schedule a meeting. RevenueHero eliminates this tedious process and accelerates scheduling of meetings from websites. This gives a delightful experience for the prospect as well as the sales person.RevenueHero powers the various workflows and rules that are involved in scheduling these meetings. Consider a company selling to small businesses as well as enterprise businesses. When a prospect visits the company's website and fills up a form, it is important that the right team or person talks to them. RevenueHero allows marketing teams to define rules that say - \"if prospect has < 500 employees, schedule meetings with SMB team\" and \"if prospect has > 500 employees, schedule meetings with the Enterprise team\". This is how RevenueHero typically works. Company onboards their Sales team onto RevenueHeroThe sales people connect their calendars and conferencing tool i.e. Zoom to RevenueHero.The marketing ops people define the rules and workflows that determine who gets a meeting. Once defined, the RevenueHero snippet is copied and installed on the website through which prospects try to book a meeting.With the snippet enabled, customers can find the best time slots for them to talk to sales.RevenueHero records these meetings and uses Zoom APIs to generate and send meeting links to customers through email.At the time of the meeting, customers can simply click these links and join the meeting with the Sales agents.TURN MORE INBOUND LEADS INTO MEETINGS WITH REVENUEHERO",

It also allows you to improve the process, coaching, and communication of your sales team by providing a user interface to send quick feedback and share examples of sales calls between colleagues.Zoom integration allows you to seamlessly integrate PitchPatterns into your sales process without extra work from your side.

Our Zoom integration revolutionizes your recruitment process, extracting crucial information from screening calls, summarizing the data, and updating each candidate's record in your ATS. Trust Squire, a leader in conversation intelligence for the recruitment industry, to transform your Zoom conversations into high-quality, actionable insights, and to elevate your recruitment efficiency.The process is straightforward, connect your Zoom account to Squire with the click of one button in the Squire app - www.squireapp.io - and be able to utilise Squire in both Zoom video calls and Zoom phone calls. Zoom Video Calls﻿Open up the Squire app in your Zoom video call, log in with your Squire credentials and get access to the value of Squire. You can enter the name, email, and phone number of the candidate you are interviewing, and select the role you are interviewing them for from a dropdown menu - this will show you the list of questions that are applicable to that role and once you've completed the call, Squire will transcribe and process the recording, seamlessly updating the candidate record in your applicant tracking system (ATS). Zoom Phone CallsThe Zoom phone calls are really magical. In the Squire web app, you will need to select a \"default role\" for phone calls, in the settings page when you are logged in. Once the default role has been selected, and you've logged in to the Squire app in your Zoom account, then you simply conduct your phone calls like usual. Squire picks up the recording, passes the information through our processing and boom, out comes perfect candidate notes, updated directly into your applicant tracking system. Important Note. To use Squire with Zoom Video Calls, you must have either a Pro, Business or Enterprise Zoom account. To use Squire with Zoom Phone Calls, you must have either a Business or Enterprise Zoom account.

        "description": "Please download ZoomCuts from https://liminalet.com/zoomcutsApple provides powerful ways for automation with the Shortcuts app, allowing apps to provide actions that users can then use to create their own custom shortcuts. A shortcut is a fast way to get one or more tasks done. Actions from different applications can be combined to form a shortcut to perform tasks that would be otherwise difficult or impossible to do from one of these individual applications. Users can then interact with these shortcuts with the Shortcuts app or invoke them using SiriZoomCuts exposes many popular and useful commands for hosts and users alike within Shortcuts. ZoomCuts allows users to raise or lower their hand, send in-meeting chat, get a list of participants, join meetings, and much more. Furthermore, ZoomCuts allows users to interact with other third-party applications on macOS that supports Shortcuts, enabling automation workflows that would normally take several seconds or minutes to accomplish manually.Automation increases reliability, giving you the confidence to build meetings and webinars around complicated sequences of events. You can use these frameworks to implement rapid pinning, participant management, automated chat, and other powerful meeting commands into your production flow.",

That recording is then turned into a SmartTranscript which is delivered to you by email, so it is fully searchable from your email client, by content, date and participant. You can even keep a copy in your cloud storage so that it can automatically be linked to the meeting in your calendar (requires Outlook plugin).What is a SmartTranscript? Available in English, French, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese, the SmartTranscript not only gives you a transcript of your Zoom meeting, it looks for all of the key things that were said, and identifies them for you so you don't have to read the whole transcript to find what is important. You can quickly search for anything: the system is even smart enough to let you search for common mistrancriptions to find what the speech recognition might have missed.You can add your own custom topics as well as edit the transcript.If you use Zoom transcription already, at your option, we can use this instead.Did you present slides in your meeting? Myna reads all of the content, makes its searchable and produces \"SnapTags\" of the most important content to get you straight back into the most important part of your meeting.",

Participant may not be for you, and that's OK. Here's what it gives you:• Get back in that meeting quickly – your recent meeting IDs and passcodes are stored and one tap away. No more searching for the link or trying to find the passcode in an email.• Control of your mic, camera, and raised hand – always on-screen and easy to reach.• Watch app – control your meeting from across the room. Use the Apple Watch app to control the mic, camera, and raised hand in a meeting on iPhone or iPad.• Data Saver Mode – bad connection or on cellular? Use Data Saver to turn off your camera and stop streaming videos. This will reduce your data usage by approximately 60-95% depending on the number of participants.• Put videos in focus – configure columns, focus on active cameras only, or hold and drag to sort it just how you like it.• Threaded chat – Pro users can use threaded chat. No more accidentally responding to everyone when you meant to DM.• Get on the big screen – share to your Apple TV and you have total control of what is shown on the external display.• Zoom in/zoom out – simply tap a video to get a larger view. Tap again to close it.• Control host requests – you control what happens if a host asks to unmute or start your camera: ask, always allow, or automatically allow if your hand is raised.Thanks for giving Participant a try.

Also they can select if the event will be \"Invitation based\" or \"Registration based\". Events are created as private by default.

Users with admin rights can upload an excel file and register users to an event on the Register Users page. Also members can self-register to events. Live Sessions can then be initiated with Zoom webinar. This event will automatically be created on Zoom webinar account and all registrants will automatically be synced in Zoom webinar.

They can create Live Sessions in their Academy by filling fields such as \"Title\", \"Description\", \"Category\", \"External Instructors\", \"Academy Instructors\". Also they can select if the event will be \"Invitation based\" or \"Registration based\". Events are created as private by default. After the creation of an event, if it should be visible to the whole academy, it should be turned to public. Only admins and training managers with the right to edit events, can make an event private or public. A public event will be visible to the academy, or to a particular group of people when added in a category with enabled access permissions. Users with admin rights can upload an excel file and register users to an event on the Register Users page. Also members can self-register to events. Live Sessions can then be initiated with Zoom webinar. This event will automatically be created on Zoom webinar account and all registrants will automatically be synced in Zoom webinar. Then, the event can be started from Schoox by those having the relevant permission. Registered users can join from Schoox. Once the event completed, registrants’ progress will be synced from Zoom webinar to Schoox.",

This app has your back in real time.The best part? Everything uploads automatically into Gong — your notes and notifications, the call recording, etc. — so you don’t have to annotate the call later. A huge chunk of your admin work is done the minute you hang up the call. Makes for a pretty sweet to-do list, huh? You can finally ditch those dreaded tasks, all while improving collaboration across your selling team.Plus, it’s really easy to keep everything about your deal and each customer’s context organized in Gong. Your company’s Gong users can easily access whatever info they need about a customer without having to interrupt your work.Go on. Spend more time selling (and winning!). Install the Gong app for Zoom today.",

We are convinced that \"getting the right medical care at the right time\" is a very important goal for humanity.Existing telehealth systems are designed to require patients to install special applications.And this is both a burden on the patient and on the hospital, especially for older patients. (For patients to consult the hospital on how to use it.) Also, many existing telehealth systems have problems with the quality of video calls.“Anyone can use it easily and provide medical treatment with stable quality.” This is the value that YaDoc Quick offers.That's why YaDoc Quick uses Zoom for video calling. The user does not need to install any special application other than Zoom. YaDoc Quick provides a series of procedures for medical appointment, telehealth treatment, and payment as a simple and seamless experience.Usage on a patient sideA patient accesses the Web form for each medical institution and registers the email address used for an appointment.Once the appointment is completed, a patient will be emailed with the Zoom URL for a telehealth consultation at the appointment date and time.Usage on a medical institution sideA medical institution logs in to the account and configures the following items required for the appointment on the administration screen.The URL for appointments assigned to each medical institution will be distributed to patients on the homepage or by email.DisclaimerIn order for your system to work as expected, your device must be set to JST (Japan Standard Time).",

This will set that user up with theirown Zoom account.To use Zoom on a daily basis, right click on any appointment in the diary and select either \"Email zoom link\" to send an email to the patient that contains a button to join a call.

But if you have to, you can use Padlet to make your meetings less soul-crushing, and even delightful.Padlets are visual boards where you can write, upload files, and embed links with other people. You can see everyone's contributions in real-time and collaborate with comments and reactions. Padlets are beautiful to look at and fun to contribute to.Our app for Zoom apps brings all this goodness right into your Zoom call, making Padlet an excellent choice for:Meeting agendasReviewing filesBrainstormingQ&AsCollecting responses from an audienceSlideshowsSlideshows? Where did that come from? Well, padlets can easily be turned into beautiful slideshows. These slideshows are 10x prettier than presentations made with other software and take 1/10th the time to make.You can put your Padlet slideshow on the screens of your participants. It's a lot, lot better than a simple screenshare of something on your computer:Your participants will see a full-resolution, pixel-perfect presentation instead of a blurry, pixelated screen.The slideshow will adjust to each person's device. They'll see everything clearly, regardless of their screen size.You control the slide on everyone's screen. But a participant can navigate to a different point in the presentation if they need to.Fyodor Dostoevsky said, \"Beauty will save the world.\" Dostoevsky would have loved Padlet.",

Through partnerships with some of the most progressive hospitals and health systems in the world, Get Well uses digital technology to improve the healthcare experience for patients, their families, and clinicians. Get Well is leading the movement towards a more collaborative and participatory patient and family experience. \n\nAs a patient receiving care in a hospital, individuals are not always able to visit with the people they love and care about. The care process is enriched by the participation of a patient’s loved ones. Being able to see them and talk to them while the patient is treated or is recovering in the hospital provides incalculable benefits to a patient’s well-being.\n\nIn the spirit of one of Get Well’s core tenets of  leading patients toward a more participatory and family experience, Get Well’s Zoom video conferencing capability connects the patient to friends and family through Zoom solutions deployed directly into the hospital room by clicking and entering a phone number or email address. \n\nPatients can now add family members and friends into the care process by including them in important conversations with their care team. Patients in isolation as well as younger patients with siblings that are not able to visit the hospital can now communicate with their loved ones face to face through Zoom and Get Well’s shared technology.\n\nBringing together the powerful tools Zoom and Get Well offer, patients are given effective mechanisms to enrich their hospital stay experience; family and friends are provided channels into supporting their loved one during a trying time, and hospital staff are given additional tools to enhance the healing care their patients need.",

You can start the game from within your meeting and easily control the screen area of the game and the other participants’ videos. Players are separated into two groups: the villagers and the werewolves. The villagers' goal is to find out the werewolves' identity whereas werewolves are trying to stay as inconspicuous as possible to overrun the village. The werewolves must hide their dark role and act as regular villagers.Every night, werewolves select and eat one poor villager. When the morning rises, that player is off the game, but can still observe. The villagers’ mission is to discuss and investigate who might be werewolves among them. Every player (even the werewolves) selects one other villager whom they think is a werewolf and votes for them. After everyone has voted, the person with the most votes is exiled and is off the game. The exiled person may or may not be the werewolf, which is not revealed yet.After the exiling, the game continues with the same pattern: the night sets up again and werewolves select their next victim. Once again, one villager is eaten and the next morning, other villagers must discuss and vote for the most potential werewolf among them.The game ends when either the villagers have managed to exile all the werewolves or the werewolves have overrun the village.So gather up your team and have a fun and safe get-together in Zoom!",

Future versions of this integration will look at capturing attendance and other useful features.This app requires you have a VET Campus portal hosted with us and integrated to your student management system.

That way, whenever they need to ask you a question, they will know if now is a good moment to interrupt, and if not, when later will be a more opportune moment. Thus, you can ideally focus for longer durations with less interruptions, while at the same time, effectively interact and collaborate with your team.Learn more about the research project, developed by the Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab at the University of Zurich, Switzerland here: http://hasel.dev/flowteamsWhy use the Zoom Connector for FlowTeams?FlowTeams allows you to connect to the most frequently used communication apps, including Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Slack. Connecting to these apps will allow you to sync the presence status of these apps to FlowTeams (e.g. online, away, in-meeting, in-call), so you'll need to change your Flow Status less frequently manually. Of course, you are free to chose which apps you want to connect and which status sync you want to allow.The following website explains how to connect your Zoom account to FlowTeams: https://flowteams.ifi.uzh.ch/documents/documentation#commu-app-zoomNote 1: Only your current Zoom Presence Status is accessed by FlowTeams, and only locally, so it is not sent to the FlowTeams server.Note 2: The IT department of your organization might have blocked access to these connectors by default. Contact us to receive instructions for the IT department to approve FlowTeams.",

Alternatively, Dialpad users can also use the /zoom command to pull up a new card or select the arrow next to the Call icon and choose Zoom Meeting. The /zoom command also works on mobile, so users can connect even when they’re on the go.Got a group of people that need to be included? No problem—simply select Start a Zoom Meeting from the drop-down menu on the left-hand sidebar of your Dialpad app to start adding more people. Once you’re ready, hit Enter to send the message with the conference invite card included. The Dialpad for Zoom integration requires a Dialpad Pro or Enterprise license type",

As a result, you face a constant battle securing corporate data from those that shouldn’t have access.Some companies use a single sign-on (SSO) technology to track and enforce security access. But SSO only works for the systems to which it’s connected. Most organizations don't deploy SSO for all their SaaS vendors – especially when Shadow SaaS is rampant and employees are using unauthorized SaaS apps. What's more, many organizations grant access privileges to users outside their SSO processes.This security blind spot can expose you to the theft of proprietary data. And it can open you to enormous regulatory compliance risks. GDPR, for example, requires you to understand which systems contain personally identifiable data, and who has access. With the Flexera SaaS Manager Slack integration you will be able to get detailed usage and cost data by internal user segment, Allocate SaaS investments by the department for financial reporting, Identify users logging into Slack that are no longer active, See users that have not been actively using their Slack license to reclaim these licenses for other users and have visibility into your usage and entitlements to easily validate your investment to help your renewal process by providing the data to clearly show \"how many licenses you need\", not just how many you have.",

This solution provides the following features: 1. Five9 agents enjoy a consolidated view of the address book which now contains, in addition to Five9 agents, all the Zoom contacts in the enterprise which have been assigned a phone number. This feature works on the native Five9 Agent Desktop Plus (ADP) UI as well as all the Five9 CRM adapters using Agent Desktop Toolkit+ (ADT+) UI.  2. Five9 agents can view the real-time presence status of their Zoom contacts at-a-glance right from their address book.3. Simple one click-to-call enables Five9 agents to initiate an Agent-Expert-Consultation call. This can be a transfer, consultation call with a Zoom contact, or a conference call including the Zoom contact and the customer.  This increases First Call Resolution by providing the agent easy access to back office subject matter experts and thereby increases customer satisfaction and loyalty.4. Five9 Zoom UC Adapter can be easily installed from the Zoom App Marketplace.Note: For Five9 customers hosted in Canada, use Five9-CA app.",

It's no longer easy to tell what the consensus is and it is easy to mess up the countdown and fall victim to bias by seeing other teammates’ votes before revealing your own.This app moves the planning meeting into your Zoom window, allowing you to vote and find consensus easily.What is planning poker?Planning poker, also called SCRUM poker or pointing poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate the effort or relative size of development goals in software development. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.",

A service provider can decide if their service is FREE or PAID (and if they'd like to donate to charity). When using the 30mins.com Zoom Meetings Integration Application, you will have access to the Zoom Meetings conference type. When this conference type is selected by a Booker, it will automatically schedule, a Zoom Meeting for the selected time. After a meeting is scheduled, you will be provided with a Start Link, Join Link, and Meeting Password. The booker will be provided with a Join Link and the Meeting Password. This information will be sent to the Emails linked to each of the participating parties accounts.

        "description": "We founded LeadAngel after years of leading sales and marketing operations departments. The challenges were always the same: leads would come in and it would take a team of sales operations colleagues way too much time to filter and distribute the leads to salespeople and account owners. Great leads would get buried in a pile of duplicate leads and inquiries from competitors. Existing accounts with a dedicated account rep might get calls from a salesperson who had no idea the company was already a customer. Senior management would ask about the state of the sales funnel and the answer was vague–how many of the new leads were truly new and from interesting targets? The lead processes we saw were slow, frustrating, and imprecise, and from our conversations with colleagues at other firms, it wasn’t much better elsewhere.We couldn’t find a better product to fix these problems so we decided to build our own. We are now proud to be the gold standard in the automated lead processing industry. We have helped hundreds of companies get their best leads to the right person right away. We eliminated the dreaded black hole that leads often fall into when an outdated lead distribution rule routes a lead to a salesperson who is too busy, works on a different geography, or has left the company. We bring order and speed to an area of sales where confusion has reigned.We look forward to speaking with you and exploring how we can improve lead management at your company. Or perhaps you’re interested in working for LeadAngel? We’re always hiring and would love to chat. Either way, we promise your inbound interest won’t get lost in our funnel.",

To use this new service, you will first need to sign up for the preview waitlist at Calendar.help. Once you are accepted into the program, scheduling a meeting is as simple as adding Cortana to the Cc: line on an email from your registered email address and ask her to schedule a meeting. Cortana handles all the back-and-forth emails to find a time when everyone can meet and then sends out an invite on your behalf. Cortana communicates with your contacts by email to provide a natural, almost human, scheduling experience. Scheduler works with your Office 365, Outlook.com, or Google calendar.",
